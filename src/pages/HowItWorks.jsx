      question: "What happens if two people claim the same item?",
      answer:
        "When multiple people claim the same item, the person who reported it as found will receive all claim requests. They can review the details provided by each claimant and choose who to contact. We recommend asking for specific details about the item (like scratches, contents, or when/where it was lost) to verify the real owner.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I know if someone claiming my item is genuine?",
      answer:
        "Always ask for specific details that only the real owner would know. For example, ask about contents of a bag, specific scratches or marks, or exactly where and when they lost it. Meet in a public place on campus and consider bringing a friend. Trust your instincts - if something feels off, don't proceed.",

      question: "Is my personal information safe on CampusLostFound?",
      answer:
        "Yes, we take privacy seriously. Your email and personal details are never displayed publicly. Only when you choose to contact someone about an item will your contact information be shared directly with that person. We never sell or share your data with third parties.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I edit or delete my posted item?",
      answer:
        "Yes, you can manage all your posted items from your Dashboard. You can edit details, mark items as found/returned, or delete posts when they're no longer needed. This helps keep the platform updated and relevant.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if I find an item but don't know what it is?",
      answer:
        "Post it anyway! Include a clear photo and describe what you see. The owner will likely recognize their item even if you're not sure what it's called. For example, 'small electronic device with buttons' might be someone's calculator or remote.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long should I wait before removing a lost item post?",
      answer:
        "We recommend keeping lost item posts active for at least 30 days. Many students check the platform periodically, and someone might find your item weeks later. For valuable items like laptops or phones, consider keeping the post longer.",
    },
    {
      question: "What items should NOT be posted on CampusLostFound?",
      answer:
        "Don't post dangerous items, illegal substances, weapons, or anything that could be used to harm others. Also avoid posting items that might contain sensitive personal information unless you can secure that information first.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use CampusLostFound if I'm not a student?",
      answer:
        "Currently, our platform is designed specifically for university students with valid .edu.pk email addresses. This helps ensure a safe, trusted community. Faculty and staff should contact their university's official lost and found office.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "What if someone contacts me about an item but doesn't show up?",
      answer:
        "Unfortunately, this can happen. We recommend giving people 24-48 hours to respond or show up, as students have busy schedules. If someone repeatedly doesn't show up, you can choose to contact other claimants or keep the item posted for others to see.",
    },
    {
      question: "How can I increase my chances of getting my lost item back?",
      answer:
        "Include clear photos, detailed descriptions, and the exact location/time you lost it. Check the platform regularly and respond quickly to any contacts. Also, consider posting on your university's social media groups and checking the physical lost & found office.",

                      Be honest about details - lying won't help you get the
                      wrong item

                    <li>Bring ID to the meetup to verify you're a student</li>
                    <li>
                      If the item isn't yours, let them know so they can help
                      the real owner
